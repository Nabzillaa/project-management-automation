The steps initially provided to us is:

# Select a Rental that requires Exchange and change the return status to be “In Transit” (this will be the status immediately after the execution of the Exchange) - at this point, 
## the system has a field to put the fuel level of the 1st vehicle as well as the odometer reading,
## {color:#bf2600}*this is too early in the process* {color}and the branch won’t know this information just yet.

!image-20260202-001606.png|width=419,alt=""image-20260202-001606.png""!
# Reserve a vehicle for Exchange at a future date time
# When the time comes, go to delivery scheduler and filter for Exchange at pending request
# Assign CSE to the Exchange job then become confirmed at the scheduled request
# The Exchange task then appears at the assigned CSE’s checklist
# Open the Exchange checklist and send ETA if required
# CSE goes to the assigned vehicle and commences delivery of the Exchange
# *When CSE arrives at the customer, open up the Exchange checklist, fill in checkout odometer, fuel level, delivery and/or memo*
# Then save the passed checklist - the checklist items are not mandatory but passing the checklist is mandatory
# Now the vehicles have been swaped in the rental record
# Open the mobile app and look for the assigned rental
# Click on the “i” icon at the top right corner of the rental and selet “re-sign”
# Select Exchange Form and show template to the customer
# Then sign and conduct inspection
# Exchange completed and update the status of the return vehicle to “Available” when it is returned to the branch and ready to be on hire again

Krizia will need to test:

Workaround 1: Prior to doing the actual swap via the vehicle checklist page, 

# CSE to jump on the mobile app > go to rental > update odometer reading of 1st vehicle
# CSE goes back to the checklist page > enter odometer out of 2nd vehicle and do the swap.

NOTE: Would this update the odometer of the 1st vehicle?



Workaround 2: after doing the exchange > CSE to jump on vehicles tab on web platform and update odometer in

* need to check if CSE can access vehicles tab and if they can update odometer in
* Would they call someone at branch to have this updated while doing an exchange? - Admin task



SUGGESTION: Move the odometer in & fuel in fields to the checklist page but this will require customisation and effort",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56557,CIP-153,Fleet System,In Progress,02/Feb/26 11:24 AM

It’s working fine in Test now, but still not in Prod.
Quick question: do we actually need the password fields to be mandatory? Since we only really need them for mobile login (and only when someone actually uses it), and SSO is coming eventually—not everyone needs mobile anyway.

I believe all the latest updates are currently on the test environment and have not yet been merged into production. That’s why the login works in test but not in production.

I will check and see if we can make the password optional.

This is because a cancellation was recorded on *2026-01-20 15:08:01.613*.

However, *MBK_RS46 was already converted into Rental Agreement MBK_RA5 on 2025-12-18 15:57:56.000*, and the agreement had already been completed/processed before the cancellation happened. For that reason, the cancellation on the reservation *does not impact the rental agreement or the invoice* — the invoicing remains valid.

If you’d like, we can add a control so that once a reservation is converted to a rental agreement, the *reservation cancellation option/link is disabled* to avoid confusion in the future.","30/Jan/26 6:29 AM;712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa;Hi [~accountid:712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab] ,  Another example is [MBK_RS42|https://fleet.right2drive.com.au/ReservationMain.aspx?ReservationID=161] - is in the Invoiced Ready list.

I have imported Master Rates to AKL location with a ExtraKMCharge of “0.2”. 

The value has loaded this time but it’s changed the numbers and added multiple decimal points. Can you fix this so it simply populates as “0.2” like we provided in the API payload?

Extra KM Charge Calculation,CIP-911,73357,Enhancement Request,Triaging,CIP,Continuous Improvement Project,software,Vicki Hartley,6195e625f241500072581555,,High,,Shiela Araullo,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,Shiela Araullo,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,Shiela Araullo,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,19/Jan/26 2:57 PM,02/Feb/26 10:34 AM,,,,,,0,"h2. {color:#0747a6}RentCentric Current Setup{color}

When *Extra KM Charge* is configured the system calculates extra charges by multiplying:

* Excess kilometers
* “Extra KM Charge” value
* Number of rental days

h3. Current Calculation

{noformat}Extra KM Charge =
(Used KM – Allowed KM) × Extra KM Charge × Rental Days{noformat}

h2. {color:#0747a6}Business Requirement (Enhancement request){color}

For our existing pricing and invoicing process, Extra KM Charge is not by the total number of days. Extra KM Charge is applied *once per excess kilometer*, regardless of the rental duration

h4. Example

* Allowed KM: 100
* Used KM: 125
* Excess KM : Used KM - Allowed KM
* Extra KM Charge: $0.2

*Charge Calculation:*

{noformat}Excess KM x Extra KM Charge = Total Extra KM Charge
  25      x     0.2         = $5.00{noformat}



So for the Master Rates setup,

*Extra KM Charge* (on the top field, encircle in {color:#36b37e}*green*{color}) - will apply to all vehicle types where in their individual Extra KM Charge field is not populated

*KM Allowed column* - will apply to the whole rental period. 

E.g. 100KM - which means regardless it’s 1 day rental or 1 month rental, system will start charging beyond the allowed KM

*Extra KM Charge* (column; which is for each row of vehicle type) - if this is 0, then it will get the value of *Extra KM Charge* in {color:#36b37e}*green*{color}; else it will used the value populated on the respective row.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.

What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.

How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Regarding the item *“Rental Will Be Charged To,”* we have left this field blank because we are not sure what is required. Could you please clarify whether this field should contain the customer name, the company name, or something else?

Please review and let us know your feedback.

In the customer profile it is showing the City as Auckland when it should be showing the suburb Hurstville that was saved in the reservation.

When looking into it further, its pulling from the customer profile that's created once the reservation has been created and is defaulting to a CITY and Auckland.

# Regarding the city issue, we’ve updated the test system, and it should now work correctly for new reservations.
# For the cancellation reason point: this is the behavior you previously requested.

It is not actively utilized, and no specific requirements have been defined for its use at this time.
As an interim measure, users can manually apply the appropriate discount during the Rental phase (via Misc. Charges, as shown in Shiela's screenshot) based on the agreed discount code.
Looking ahead, we will raise an enhancement request to explore options for mapping a set of discount codes directly to corresponding rates/discounts.
For your reference, please find the current discount configuration settings in the system attached below. However, we would require confirmation from RC on the intended usage and any guidance on how this feature can best be leveraged.

System Enhancement for Centralized Company Master Data Management,CIP-882,71844,Enhancement Request,Triaging,CIP,Continuous Improvement Project,software,Vicki Hartley,6195e625f241500072581555,,Medium,,,,Shiela Araullo,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,Shiela Araullo,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,08/Jan/26 1:54 PM,20/Jan/26 10:06 AM,,,,,,0,"h2. *Current State Overview*

In RentCentric, companies (corporates) are currently maintained on a *per-location basis*. While there is an option to *“Share Company”*, this functionality only allows companies to be _viewed_ by other locations.

When creating a reservation:

* Only companies created within the *requesting location* can be selected or referenced.
* Companies created in other locations *cannot* be referenced.

As a result, a reservation can only use a company that was created in the same location.

This limitation is related to a previously encountered integration issue
(Item #6: _Repair Facility – Reclaim → RentCentric integration_):
[https://rentcentric.visualstudio.com/Movigo/_workitems/edit/13656/|https://rentcentric.visualstudio.com/Movigo/_workitems/edit/13656/]

h2. Data Synchronization Challenges

The master company list comes from Reclaim, where companies are maintained independently of location.

To synchronize data between Reclaim and RentCentric, the current approach manually import the company list across *all RentCentric locations*, where:

* Each location receives a *separate company record*
* Each record has a *unique company code*
* Company details are otherwise identical

This results in *duplicate company records* across locations.
For example, _CompanyABC_ exists as a single record in Reclaim, but is created multiple times in RentCentric—once per location.

h2. Operational Impact

This approach introduces significant data maintenance challenges:

* When a new company is created in Reclaim, it must be created *N times* in RentCentric (once per location).
* Any updates to an existing company in Reclaim must also be manually copied across all locations in RentCentric.
* Company data mapping in Boomi will also need to be updated (this maps Reclaim company name to RentCentric company name, then company id to each and every location).

Company data is currently maintained across multiple systems:

* *Reclaim* (MDM – master source)
* *RentCentric* (per branch)
* *Boomi* (company mappings)

h3. Current Process for New Company Creation

# Company is created in Reclaim.
# The same company is manually created in each RentCentric branch.
# Corresponding Boomi company mappings are manually updated using RentCentric company IDs.

h3. Key Issues

This process is:

* Very manual
* Time-consuming
* Prone to human error
* Susceptible to missed updates, resulting in data desynchronization

Maintaining company data across multiple systems leads to:

* Duplicate data maintenance
* Inconsistent or outdated company information
* Operational inefficiency
* Increased support and reconciliation effort

There is currently *no single real-time source of truth* being consistently consumed by downstream systems.

h2. {color:#0747a6}Proposed Enhancement{color}

h3. 1. Global Company Model in RentCentric

Instead of maintaining companies on a *location-based model*, RentCentric should support a *global company list*.

* A single, centralized company record is maintained
* All locations can reference the same company when creating reservations
* Company creation location becomes irrelevant for reservation usage

This enhancement enables *seamless cross-location usage* of company records and eliminates unnecessary duplication.

h3. 2. Long-Term Enhancement: Company Master Data API

Implement a *Company Master Data API* sourced directly from *Reclaim*

Instead of maintaining company listings independently in: RentCentric per branch ; and Boomi company mappings

All downstream systems will *retrieve company data dynamically* from Reclaim via the API.

h2. Proposed Architecture / Solution Overview

h3. 1. Reclaim as Master Source

* Reclaim remains the authoritative system for company data
* All company creation, updates, and maintenance occur exclusively in Reclaim (via MDM)

h3. 2. Company Data API

A centralized API exposed by Reclaim to provide:

* Company list
* Company details (by Company ID or other identifiers)

The API will support *real-time or near–real-time* data retrieval.

h3. 3. RentCentric Integration

When company data is required on any RentCentric screen:

* RentCentric calls the *Reclaim Company API*
* No local company master list is maintained in RentCentric

This eliminates the need to:

* Manually create companies per branch
* Maintain duplicate company records
* Boomi to maintain company mapping (for Reclaim ↔︎ RentCentric)

h2. Scope of Enhancement

h3. In Scope

* API development and exposure from Reclaim
* RentCentric updates to consume company data via API
* Boomi integration updates to use the same API
* Removal of manual company maintenance processes

h2. Benefits

* Single source of truth for company data
* Elimination of manual data entry and duplication
* Reduced risk of human error
* Improved data consistency and synchronization
* Lower operational overhead
* Scalable architecture for future system integrations",,Shiela Araullo,,,,,,,,,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@15ee2254,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#deebff}

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

[~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa]  the mismatch for Sallens is two issues:

# it tried to import NRMA instead of Coles (i.e. NAF Insurer instead of AF Insurer) which will be fixed by Richard .
# the ID numbers we have set up for the insurers in production are DIFFERENT to the test environment. I.e. NRMA ID in production is 423, but in test it’s for Sallens. Hence the mismatch. I will ask Richard to set up a second reference list of TEST company IDs.

[~accountid:712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef]  per point 2 above, please update the TEST ATOM CRT table for XREF Insurers to use the attached ID list:

You can send a signature request even if the rental is closed. You can verify this behavior in the test environment.

*Change request:* Make Additional Driver first name mandatory in both Reclaim and Rentcentric

*Reasoning:*

* This will prevent empty entries for additional driver from both Reclaim and Rentcentric in the event that users add them by accident.
* Both change will need to be applied to both Reclaim and Rentcentric to avoid issues wherein credit hires are created directly into Rentcentric and updates will be sent to Reclaim

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Few issues that I can see with the Rental webhooks going into Reclaim:

* insertionOrderID is missing from the hire booking section of the payload (insertionOrderID must be included to UPDATE the existing entry instead of creating a new one)
* insertionOrderId is missing from the vehicle detalis section (same issue as above)
* vehicle exchange table: this would create a new entry, but again - if it’s meant to be an update o an existing entry in Reclaim then it needs to include an insertionOrderId

You should be able to get all the InsertionOrderID values from the “GetWorkItem” API call to Reclaim.

Please check 🙂

This will require RC support to investigate - will create a linked defect. Note: when I “UnVoid” the rental, it correctly sends a webhook with the latest update.

I think what’s happening is that the “Rental webhook” would be triggered once the reservation becomes “honored”. So the hire status should be updated from the Rental webhook instead.","05/Jan/26 3:36 PM;712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef;[~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] Im not seeing any triggers for Rental during the time that the reservation becomes “honored”.

Few issues that I can see with the Rental webhooks going into Reclaim:

* insertionOrderID is missing from the hire booking section of the payload (insertionOrderID must be included to UPDATE the existing entry instead of creating a new one)
* insertionOrderId is missing from the vehicle detalis section (same issue as above)
* vehicle exchange table: this would create a new entry, but again - if it’s meant to be an update o an existing entry in Reclaim then it needs to include an insertionOrderId

You should be able to get all the InsertionOrderID values from the “GetWorkItem” API call to Reclaim.

Please check 🙂

I think what’s happening is that the “Rental webhook” would be triggered once the reservation becomes “honored”. So the hire status should be updated from the Rental webhook instead.","05/Jan/26 3:33 PM;712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef;[~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] Im not seeing any triggers for Rental during the time that the reservation becomes “honored”.

Few issues that I can see with the Rental webhooks going into Reclaim:

* insertionOrderID is missing from the hire booking section of the payload (insertionOrderID must be included to UPDATE the existing entry instead of creating a new one)
* insertionOrderId is missing from the vehicle detalis section (same issue as above)
* vehicle exchange table: this would create a new entry, but again - if it’s meant to be an update o an existing entry in Reclaim then it needs to include an insertionOrderId

You should be able to get all the InsertionOrderID values from the “GetWorkItem” API call to Reclaim.

Please check 🙂

* {color:#bf2600}*Summary pages opens up and it seems like the Baby Seat has been removed (unticked)*{color}
** Workaround - CSE will need to tick this again

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

This seems to be working for my user group when I have tested it. 

I have had [~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa] test it and record it as we haven't given her account permission to edit the referral agency but it is allowing her to change this. 

In the recording you will be able to see:

# When we open the rental and edit and scroll down to the Referral Field its editable. 
# As Krizia, goes to edit the reservation details, she can edit the referral agency. 
# When we click save to changing the referral agency field, we are receiving a server error. 

Going back to the reservation the change hasn't saved. 

Can you also confirm, where am i meant to see the audit trail?

When we have provided her permission, she is able to edit the referral field when editing the rental and is able to update it but when she has edited the reservation the field is greyed out for her.

Video 2 - I have tested it with giving myself permission and I am able to edit the referral field and the referral agency field. As you can see when i update the referral field when editing the rental, it does not update the referral agency in the reservation.

Non-revenue hires can currently only be created through the Scheduler and do not generate an invoice.
At present, non-revenue hires are limited to a timeframe within a single day. This enhancement request proposes extending the functionality to allow non-revenue hires to span multiple days (i.e., bookings with specified start and end dates and times).


*Proposed behavior / requirement:*
When a non-revenue hire is requested (i.e., when a vehicle is assigned to a non-revenue task), the system must validate that the requested date and time range does not overlap with any existing reservations or bookings for that vehicle. Standard vehicle availability checks must be enforced to prevent double-booking.


Please let me know if you require any additional details or clarification.

This categorisation must be retained when documents are transmitted from Rent Centric to Reclaim, ensuring files are accurately mapped to the corresponding document types rather than being defaulted to a generic “Other” category.

If we can implement something similar to what we have on the R2D website which looks like the snippet below where users can:

* Select the type of photo they want to upload e.g. select registration paper > uploads a document / photo then it automatically maps it to that specific file name 
* When rentcentric pushes the docs to reclaim it will then be mapped accurately

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.

What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.

How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Hi [~accountid:712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab] , I checked the test environment and it seems like it has been updated and this UI can actually work. If we can just maybe update the values to:

* Accident Location
* Additional Drivers Licence
* AF Damage Images
* AF Drivers Licence
* Bpoint Screenshot
* NAF Damage Images
* NAF Drivers Licence
* NAF Owner Drivers Licence
* Registration Paper
* Other


*Note:* It should let users to upload multiple attachments with the same document type if required. For example, Users can select NAF Damage Images document type for 2 photos and as per Vicki should be sequential.



I have also noticed that the user is required to upload the photos one at a time, is it possible for the steps to be:

# Select photos > classify document type
# Select another photo > classify document type
# User clicks *upload -* this way users can upload multiple photos and just clicks the upload button once.



This is to streamline the photo / document upload into Reclaim

We charge extra for KM exceeding 1000 flat - which means even how long the rental is, once it reached 1000km then we start charging



In rates master,

Rate type = Daily Rate Only

Extra KM Charge = 0.2

!image-20260111-234059.png|width=943,alt=""image-20260111-234059.png""!



For Passenger Large < $70 K

KM Daily is set to 1000, with extra km charge 0.25

!image-20260111-234144.png|width=943,alt=""image-20260111-234144.png""!



However, when rental is created instead of 1000KM - it then multiplies it with the total number of days (28), rather than only allowed 1000KM for the rental.  how to setup such that the max free KM allowed is only 1000 KM (regardless of the length of rent)…anything in excess of that will be charged with 0.25 per extra?

It would require a new custom development. According to the existing system logic, the rental length is always taken into account in the calculation.

For the first point related to the contract template form, please provide a *rental number* that includes a daily KM rate so we can check why it is not being populated in the form.","19/Jan/26 3:40 PM;712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381;Enhancement request created

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.

# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.

For miscellaneous charges, assign the vehicles to which the charges should apply. Do *not* mark the entry as mandatory or as a default mischarge.

With this setup, miscellaneous charges will *not* be applied when a reservation is created. However, when the rental is created, these charges will appear in the charge items list, where you can choose to tick or untick them to include or exclude them from the final charges.

Using the vehicle registration as the Vehicle ID improves clarity and usability for both branch and fleet users, as vehicles can be easily identified and searched without relying on an abstract or non-intuitive numeric identifier. This approach reduces the risk of assigning or selecting the incorrect vehicle and streamlines operational workflows.

From a fleet management perspective, enforcing the Registration Number as the Vehicle ID also eliminates the challenge of tracking sequential or manually assigned ID numbers during vehicle setup, thereby reducing administrative effort and potential data inconsistencies.",,Helena Georgiadis,Islam Abdou,Vicki Hartley,,,,,,,712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a,712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab,6195e625f241500072581555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21600,21600,,0%,21600,21600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26/Jan/26 8:47 AM;25981fc3-0e6f-4f59-b91c-2e27282c5f75;image-20260125-214741.png;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/52208,29/Jan/26 6:12 AM;25981fc3-0e6f-4f59-b91c-2e27282c5f75;image-20260128-191129.png;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/53095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@3220747,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#deebff}

  Now when creating a new vehicle:

# The Vehicle ID is auto-generated (next sequential number)
# The Registration Number is automatically set to the same value as the Vehicle ID
# The Registration field is disabled/read-only - users cannot type in it

  When editing an existing vehicle:

# The Registration Number displays the existing value (which was set at creation time)
# The Registration field is disabled/read-only - users cannot change it

  This ensures vehicles are always identifiable by their registration number (which equals the Vehicle ID), reducing the risk of incorrect vehicle assignment and
  eliminating manual ID management.

We will require the registration number to be the editable as it needs to be the registration of our R2D vehicle not the number of vehicles within the system. Once we input the registration in the field, we will require it to update the vehicle ID or have the Vehicle ID editable for us to update it accordingly. 

Can you please action accordingly.

The system shall enable branch users to update limited reservation details (e.g. vehicle assignment and delivery/pickup or return/drop-off date time) directly from the Delivery Scheduler, without requiring navigation back through multiple steps to the original reservation. This functionality may be provided via a pop-up or inline editing mechanism. All standard vehicle and CSE availability checks must be enforced when updates are made directly within the Booking Requests.

*Rationale:*
Currently, when a branch receives a pending or scheduled request that requires changes, users must navigate through five steps to update the details, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Enabling direct editing from the Delivery Scheduler will streamline the workflow, reduce user effort, and improve operational efficiency.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

There appears to be an issue with the license fields coming from Reclaim (for new hire bookings) for the NAF Main User.

In this particular scenario, the NAF Main User and NAF Driver are the same person. The license fields were only provided in the request payload for the NAF Driver but are missing for the NAF Main User.

The system shall capture and display *Accident Description* and *Damage Description* details within Credit Reservation to enable review of the accident circumstances. These fields must also be available and mandatory when creating a manual credit file to ensure the incident is appropriately documented.

For Credit Reservation created via *Reclaim (API)*, the Accident Description and Damage Description must be populated automatically from Reclaim. Where a placeholder or “blank” record is initially created, the corresponding fields must subsequently map back to and synchronise with the relevant data in Reclaim.

This requirement aligns with the specifications outlined in *Confluence Section 1.4.4* (highlighted in Red) - [https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BAC6Vw|https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BAC6Vw|smart-link]  

h3. *Rationale*

Accurate and consistent capture of accident and damage information is critical for understanding incident circumstances, supporting credit assessments, and ensuring data integrity across integrated systems. Ensuring these details are available for both manually created and Reclaim-generated credit records improves operational consistency, reduces rework, and supports compliance with documented business and system requirements.

# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.

Adding the Damage/Accident descriptions into RentCentric is actually a duplication of information and will lead to additional risks/rework. Claim information should be stored and managed within the Claims system (Reclaim) only; unless it’s absolutely essential in the Fleet system (e.g. needs to be populated onto the Rental Form through the fleet system).

If someone adds or changes the damage/accident description within Fleet; you want this to override the values in Reclaim? Reclaim should remain the source of truth for any accident information. The integration won’t know which version to retain if there is a conflict.

If it’s 100% essential for the Damage/accident descriptions to appear in the Fleet system in order for branch to complete their work, then I propose it be made read-only.

Notes on effort:

* Would require Reclaim development to add a new webhook trigger when these two fields are updated in Reclaim (estimate 2 days, needs to wait for a sprint)
* Would require RentCentric to add new fields to store the info in fleet system via API (?)
* Would require rework to the integrations for both creating a new hire reservation AND updating existing reservations (estimate 2 days, reliant on Reclaim and RC updates occuring first)
* If we proceed with return updates from Fleet into Reclaim (do not recommend):
** then it would also require RentCentric to add these new fields into the webhook on their side (?)
** and rework to integrations to load the update into Boomi (unable to estimate properly as we would need to find a solution as to how we recognise which version to store if there are updates flowing both ways)",07/Jan/26 2:53 PM;6195e625f241500072581555;RentCentric has estimated 12 hours effort their side,08/Jan/26 9:37 AM;712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a;[~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] Alternatively we can ask the CSE to document the damage and accident description in the notes to save the time and expense of building this out. But we run the risk of the CSE forgetting to capture these details as its not there for them to fill it out. Main reason for the fields is for the blankies as they create the lead first in RC.

# Accident and Damage Description field should be editable when a credit hire is manually created in Rentcentric.

Currently it only appears to be triggering a rental webhook when we first on-hire/start the rental; but any further edits are not triggering.

Please check MBK_RA1 as an example (actions taken at approx 3:10PM on 17th Dec):

# I edited & saved the “Rental” MBK_RA1 - this did not trigger any webhook at all and it should have.
# I then edited the reservation details of MBK_RA1 (by going through the edit rental screen and then into the reservation) and saved the reservation - this triggered a Reservation Webhook - but not a Rental webhook. It should trigger a rental webhook with the latest information.

Please make sure you are using the correct webhook URL for the “Edit Rental” webhook and that it points to the proper environment. We tested the webhook using a test URL, and it worked correctly, as mentioned in my previous comment.

Below is the current “Edit Rental” webhook URL in the production system:

Is that the correct URL?

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

We did a blankie file MBK_RS45 - straight in to RC

* Rate that was showing was $168 when starting the rental via web platform
* We on hired the vehicle MBK_RA3
* The form that the customer signed defaulted the daily rate to $0 - it returned a $0 daily rated signed contract
* When we go back and check the rental file the rate is showing as $168

Can you please update the Boomi process for RC Attachments going into Reclaim?


If the file name is “AATA+Rental Form_AU” then upload the document into Reclaim TWICE with the following document types:

# R2D_ATA_AUS_Signed
# Rental Form



If the file name is “AATA+Rental Form_NZ” then upload the doucment into Reclaim TWICE with the following document types:

# R2D_ATA_NZ_Signed
# Rental Form



We will need to figure out a better long term solution for the Reclaim document types since RC has merged them into a single document (whereas in TSD we have 2 separate documents). However this change in Boomi will be a temporary solution for now.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

*Find the matching RentCentricResID and store the ""insertionOrderId"" from that matching row. Because for the very first time that the Rental webhook triggers, we don't have any Rental Agreement Number stored in Reclaim yet - which is why it's not finding a match.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

The issue is that there is no driver type called “Owner”; the correct driver type is “Vehicle Owner.”

According to the following documentation:

[https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FMS/pages/1372356638/1.4+Fields|https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FMS/pages/1372356638/1.4+Fields]

The correct value is “Vehicle Owner,” not just “Owner.”

!image-20251216-203002.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251216-203002.png""!

What happened is that when you clicked “Edit” on the “Main User (Renter/Primary)” and then clicked “Edit” on the owner, there was no driver type called “Owner.”

As a result, the system kept the previous value, which is “Main User (Renter/Primary).”","17/Dec/25 8:48 AM;712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381;[~accountid:712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef]  can you pls help update boomi mapping for driver type, such that ‘Owner’ from Reclaim be updated to ‘Vehicle Owner’ in RC; and vise-versa. thanks!

Not urgent change, as workaround is just to populate State with any State value - however, that value might be incorrect.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.

What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

wherein, we are unable to maintain daily valuation data via UI. However, this now applies to PROD

For this scenario data will need to be deleted; however, “Settings > Rental Rates > Rate Value update” only allows future date


!image-20251214-120006.png|width=1087,alt=""image-20251214-120006.png""!



however, we need to correct the daily valuation of the past date (e.g. below 8th Dec)

As a workaround, until the system enables us to have an interface to do this from our end; pls clean up the data where given below SQL

/* this is to delete only OLD records from Daily Rate Values - and NOT Master rate; and only for the listed vehicle type */

delete from [Daily Rate Values]

We need the full request that was used to cancel that reservation so we can investigate further.

I also noticed that the claim ID in the reservation is “CID-00084799”, while the snapshots show “CID-84799”—is that expected?

Additionally, the snapshots you shared do not include the reservation number.

This has been brought up during training that it would be easier for Branch Managers to have the following details in the Pending Request Section in the Delivery Schedule:

* Have the accessories showing - Accessories Required
* Have the exact time of the delivery requested by the customer - Delivery/Pickup Date/Time if it is a Rerservation or Exchange; Return/Drop-off Date/Time if it is a Rental (this is additional information to the Date)
* Show the reservation type - Reservation Type



This will help the Branch Managers know which accessories to add without actually opening the reservation.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

I will fail for now.

The logic we have for document type is based on filename.

Logic condition is - 

if (hasAuthority && hasNz) {
    result = ""R2D_ATA_NZ_Signed"";

} else if (hasAuthority && !hasNz) {
    result = ""R2D_ATA_AU_Signed"";

} else if (hasAgreement) {
    result = ""Rental Form"";

} else if (hasInvoice) {
    result = ""Rental Invoice"";

} else {
    result = ""Other"";
}

The fllename for the file is - ""FileName"": ""12EXWEHJizU4JitDlGg46VqFAO5T6xWGrYo4QGBmLdMHPiKgsGHB1O1TDHu3LNXO.pdf"" which should go to other.

Are you not receiving a file name like this for the PDF?? There is a difference between the file names that we originally mapped for AATA/Rental Form which we need to update. But you should be getting something like the below? 

!image-20260114-220527.png|width=154,alt=""image-20260114-220527.png""!","15/Jan/26 9:18 AM;712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef;[~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] Im basing it on the filename field from payload.

For this test the filename is - ""FileName"": ""12EXWEHJizU4JitDlGg46VqFAO5T6xWGrYo4QGBmLdMHPiKgsGHB1O1TDHu3LNXO.pdf"",

And thats what im using to do the logic.

I’ve checked other payload.

[~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa]  this looks like an issue with the webhook information coming from RC. We need them to store the File Name of the AATA/RF correctly so that we can map it across, OR they need to add that new file category for these items as well.  Can you please confirm with them how it can work best? We will need Richard to then update the integration to match.

We have updated the test environment.

The *FileName* in the webhook payload will now include a prefix.

Example:
AU_Rental_AATA12EXWEHJizU4JitDlGg46Vw6NAO5YoLEQZeWsE1vdG0YmPlDC00TJTlcLsjRE4wM.pdf

Please note that the original file name remains unchanged:
12EXWEHJizU4JitDlGg46Vw6NAO5YoLEQZeWsE1vdG0YmPlDC00TJTlcLsjRE4wM.pdf

The prefix is added only in the webhook payload, not to the actual stored file.","19/Jan/26 6:28 AM;712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa;[~accountid:712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef] - are you able to map it to look for the code as they have added the prefix in the file name?

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

This is not an issue; it’s the expected system behavior. Let me explain both cases.

# *“Both baby seats and booster seats not listed”*

The allowed number of days for these items to appear on the rental is from 0 to 3 days, based on your configuration. In your example, the rental length is *4 weeks*, which is longer than the configured number of days for these charges.

Because of this, the system does not show these misc charges when the rental length exceeds the allowed days.

You might ask why *“baby seats”* appears on the saved rental. That’s because, when the rental was created, the baby seat was already pre-saved under the original reservation as an accessory.

# *“Max days was not applied”*

For the second case regarding the calculation and the comment *“max days was not applied”*: this situation will not occur. When the rental length matches the configured days for the option, the *max days* rule is applied correctly and the charges are calculated as expected.

When creating a reservation from the Reclaim API, you are sending the same email address for both main users. Because of this, the system treats them as a single customer and only selects one of them.

Please make sure to use different email addresses for the main users you select, and avoid sending the same email for multiple main users.

This ticket issue is for *Daily Rate Values,* wherein the original request of deleting duplicate records (records having same location, rate code, vehicle type and startdate - but the end date needs to be updated, however, instead of system updating it created new records) as below screenshot.

And that there is no way from our end to actually delete the duplicate record in *Daily Rate Values,* this ticket was needed to be raise so that the deletion is to be done from your end - so everytime we update the end date for daily rate values, it will create new records, and will have to raise another ticket to RentCentric to be able to delete the duplicate record.  As such as we need maintenance option for *Daily Rate Values.*

Hi [~accountid:5c8a70adee0f2d70e23c5f4a] when an invoice is marked “Write-Off”, it should not trigger the webhook to upload to Reclaim. 

Also the Qty and Hire days don’t seem correct - it says 23 while it should be 1.

Thank you.","11/Dec/25 1:39 PM;62e9c03848e310e672957b88;[~accountid:5d230ed2f61f200c217433a0] I have retested and this has failed.

The issue is the invoice status, it does not update to ‘Completed’ when the write off is triggered in Rentcentric. The only way to trigger the update of invoice status from ‘Pending’ to ‘Completed’ is to click the ‘Generate Invoice’ button which in turn triggers the upload of the invoice to Reclaim.

Regardless if a write off has been done an invoice should not go to Reclaim unpon clicking the ‘Generate Invoice’ button, or the button could be disabled.

When performing a vehicle search, the system returns _all_ available vehicles of the requested vehicle type *regardless of branch location*. This behavior does not align with the agreed search logic.

*Expected Behavior*
Per documented requirements and previous discussions:

# The initial search (triggered by the first click of *“Search”*) should occur without requiring the user to modify any search parameters, unless they intentionally perform a manual search.
# The search logic must prioritize *vehicle availability at the requested delivery/pickup branch*.
# If no vehicles of the requested type are available at the selected branch, the system should automatically search the *nearest branches within the same state*.
# The search criteria must also consider *upper or lower vehicle hierachy* when there is no exact match for the requested vehicle type.

Reference: [https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/x/FICjUg|https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/x/FICjUg|smart-link] 

*Actual Behavior*
The system ignores branch proximity and availability rules and returns all vehicles matching the requested type, regardless of their branch location.

*Impact*
This results in inaccurate availability results for users, potentially causing operational inefficiencies and incorrect vehicle assignments.

It correctly updated the existing entry for the At Fault “Main User”. However I have noticed another issue. We need to ensure it updates the correct fields based on who is the owner / driver / main user. 

When you call the Reclaim GetWorkItemDataExt API, please store these additional fields:

# vhclOwner (should be a value of “Driver”, “Business/Company”, or “Other Person”)
# MainUser_driver (should be “Yes” or “No”)
# MainUser_owner (should be “Yes” or “No”)



And make an update to the mapping into Reclaim based on the attached excel sheet which provides logic for each scenario: [^Reclaim Involved Partie Update mapping.xlsx] ","14/Jan/26 6:14 AM;712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab;[~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] Hi, I believe the issue for this card has been addressed.

However, this will still need to be fixed after the high ticketed items are done.

“Remaining” indicates that a crash occurred during the data import. For example, if the system was updating while the import was running, it might successfully read the first 272 records, then crash and stop before completing the process.

Regarding the Expiration Month and Expiration Year:

You can ignore these fields, but they must be left blank, not NULL, as shown in the snapshots.

Few issues that I can see with the Rental webhooks going into Reclaim:

* insertionOrderID is missing from the hire booking section of the payload (insertionOrderID must be included to UPDATE the existing entry instead of creating a new one)
* insertionOrderId is missing from the vehicle detalis section (same issue as above)
* vehicle exchange table: this would create a new entry, but again - if it’s meant to be an update o an existing entry in Reclaim then it needs to include an insertionOrderId

You should be able to get all the InsertionOrderID values from the “GetWorkItem” API call to Reclaim.

Please check 🙂

I do have a validation to check if Rental Agreement exist in reclaim. and if its the same as the one being processed. That way we can insert it correctly. Is it *CID-00085547*? 

Not seeing any rental agreement in reclaim.

Here are the details existing in the hire booking table in Reclaim for this case.

The “Rental update” webhook from RentCentric should have inserted the RentCentricRentalNo and updated the status at the same time

if not create a new one. I raised this one yesterday, but there seems to be an issue in DB.

I think what’s happening is that the “Rental webhook” would be triggered once the reservation becomes “honored”.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

As per requirements, AATA is only required for Credit Reservation - when we deliver/on-hire a reservation or when we request customer to sign again via email. 

Also, how can we only let customer put one initial to agree on all these terms and the signed document would return all boxes checked?

# CSE can just put N/A on this part for *Direct and Corporate Hires* - as this will not be mapped to anything
# Direct / Corporate customers signs the Rental Form



If so this has now passed, can you please confirm and change the status to Done if the above is correct.

Is this something we need to add? I figured reservations would mostly be cancelled from Reclaim - if they are cancelled from RC directly it’s probably because of an error or something right? We can default the reason populting into Reclaim for now as a quick temp fix","10/Dec/25 7:26 PM;712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa;[~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] Agree, we don’t need to add for now and we can keep the instruction that onboarding is to cancel the file in Reclaim as SOP and when branch cancel the file to leave notes so it can come across to Reclaim.

I will mark as passed now.

*On the mobile, it is supposed to show a merged AATA and Rental Form doc if Reservation Type = Credit, customer should be able to sign both in a merged document as well as checking the initial boxes setup in AATA.

Why would a vehicle type defined for one location be used in another? Likewise, why would a rate from a different location be applied elsewhere? 

The challenge now is identifying where a specific corporate rate originates, since it does not appear in the ‘Master Rates’. Instead, we must check each company by location to see whether a corporate rate was created for them. - this was raised last time, that all rates (corporate or not) should be showing in Master Rates table, to be able to list all rates, and not to have to go to hundreds of companies for each and every location, just to locate a single rate code.",,osama,Shiela Araullo,,,,,,,,5d230ed2f61f200c217433a0,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,05/Dec/25 10:08 AM;61f47503-0fc0-4c4d-b4d7-47d653f6f802;Rates Corp.mp4;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/43764,05/Dec/25 9:33 AM;61f47503-0fc0-4c4d-b4d7-47d653f6f802;Rates-Vehicle type issue.mp4;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/43754,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@4336396e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i06yk0:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Critical,,,,,,,,,,,Fleet System - QA Testing,Fleet System - Pilot,,,,,,,,,,,Fields & Data Issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025-12-05 19:57:17.051,,"05/Dec/25 10:08 AM;712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381;And it looks like all the Vehicle type is linked to the corporate rate that is from another location

The error
{{'ddlInsuranceCompany' has a SelectedValue which is invalid because it does not exist in the list of items}}
occurs when a record contains an insurance company value that is not present in the system’s configured list of insurance companies. When the screen attempts to load this record, the application cannot match that value in the dropdown, which results in the error you are seeing.

To resolve this, please ensure that the values sent via the API for the insurance company field correspond to valid insurance company IDs configured in the system. for now we updated the system to avoind the crash again. Please check and offer feedback if you need any more help.

You will need to add the BRANCH CODE prefix to the RentCentric ID number in the mapping steps though, because the ID is actually different for every branch.

Got it. But should we still use the mileage and fuel level fields on the checklist page to update the corresponding fields in the new vehicle information after the signature is done, or how should we handle this?

# Select a Rental that requires Exchange and change the return status to be “In Transit” (this will be the status immediately after the execution of the Exchange)
# Reserve a vehicle for Exchange at a future date time
# When the time comes, go to delivery scheduler and filter for Exchange at pending request
# Assign CSE to the Exchange job then become confirmed at the scheduled request
# The Exchange task then appears at the assigned CSE’s checklist
# Open the Exchange checklist and send ETA if required
# CSE goes to the assigned vehicle and commences delivery of the Exchange
# When CSE arrives at the customer, open up the Exchange checklist, fill in checkout odometer, fuel level, delivery and/or memo
# Then save the passed checklist - the checklist items are not mandatory but passing the checklist is mandatory
# Now the vehicles have been swaped in the rental record
# Open the mobile app and look for the assigned rental
# Click on the “i” icon at the top right corner of the rental and selet “re-sign”
# Select Exchange Form and show template to the customer
# Then sign and conduct inspection
# Exchange completed and update the status of the return vehicle to “Available” when it is returned to the branch and ready to be on hire again

For Credit Reservation, the rental form should be simillar to the following when signing by customer during vehicle delivery:

Date In, Time In, KMs In should be blank. After the vehicle is returned and rental is finalized, they should then be populated accordingly - PASSED

Rental Will Be Charged To should be blank - FAILED

KMs (Daily Rate) should be the KM Daily in the Master Rates setting not the normal daily rate - FAILED

Days should be blank at delivery. After the vehicle is returned and rental is finalized, it should populate the actual Days - FAILED

Other Charges should only show the rates and frequency as setup in the fees and charges. Do not show Qty and Subtotal - FAILED

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

I’ve identified some additional fields that we currently report on from our existing fleet system. I need to be able to retrieve these fields from RentCentric so we can maintain consistent reporting for our business.

Please see the attached list. It mentions which webhook/record type it relates to (e.g. reservation, rental, vehicle) and the fields/arrays required.

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know. 

(Please also ensure there are NO changes made to the field names already existing in the webhook, otherwise it will break out existing integration processes).

Please check the mapping of the Involved Parties going from Reclaim into RentCentric during the hire booking process (create res).

E.g. this NAF Main User is marked as a business (IsBusiness = “Yes”) but the business fields (e.g. name, abn, contact details) are empty.

*Additionally - the “business” can’t be the MAIN USER or DRIVER. The Main User and Driver must be an individual person. The business can only be the owner.*

E.g. of NAF Main User = is business (incorrect)

 We have reviewed and resolved the issue with the Involved Party popup on the Credit Reservation page. The mandatory field validation has been updated to align
  with the requirements specified in the documentation.

  Changes Implemented:

  When adding an At Fault involved party, the following fields are now correctly set as mandatory:

||Driver Type||Mandatory Fields||
|Main User|Blacklisted only|
|Vehicle Owner (Individual|Is Business, Blacklisted, First Name, Last Name, Mobile Phon|
|Vehicle Owner (Business)|Is Business, Blacklisted|
|Driver|Blacklisted, First Name, Last Name, Mobile Phone|

  All other fields for At Fault parties are now non-mandatory as per the requirements.

  The system will dynamically update the required field indicators (red asterisks) when selecting the Fault Type and Driver Type, providing a clear visual
  indication of which fields need to be completed.

  Please test the updated functionality at your convenience and let us know if you have any questions or require further adjustments.","05/Dec/25 8:56 AM;712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a;Hi [~accountid:712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab]

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

On a separte note when the MMS did come through it took a long time to show in the Fleet System, I spent about a minute refrreshing the page with nothing. I was discussing the issue with Vicki when I refreshed again and finally it came through.

You just need to recognise that the replycontent might be blank sometimes if there's ONLY an attachment. It's still valid

}

Content field is mapped from replyContent in messagemedia.

So I passed if there is value, if there is none then none is passed.

RC API is saying that it is required to have *content field in the payload*

!image-20251203-024242.png|width=416,alt=""image-20251203-024242.png""!

So this is not a Boomi issue.

This can be handled in boomi by writing a default content value. But i dont think its the best way to resolve this.

Making content as an optional field in RC is my suggestion.

Hi [~accountid:615f7778289a54006a3add9b]  We need RentCentric to make the “content” field in the reply SMS non-mandatory. IF the customer sends us an MMS Attachment but with no actual text, then the content field will be empty and there will only be an attachment.

Currently thr RentCentric API where we push the SMS/MMS replies is making this field mandatory which means this scenario fails to upload properly.","08/Dec/25 4:25 AM;712020:82aa7e60-100a-49b7-b30b-11acd41a6056;Hi [~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555]  [~accountid:712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef] 


We’ve updated the system, and you can now send inbound MMS without content, as shown in the snapshot below.

Regarding the delay, please note that we cannot check your application that replies to our API. To confirm that our side is working as expected, please send an inbound MMS through Postman.

If I open the invoice for the these fiels MBK_Inv_27 there are 21 rentals listed from multiple branches.

MBK_Rent_50, MBK_Rent_78 and MBK_Rent_50 are included.

I have looked at these 3 references and there is some similar data across the reservations, perhaps this is causing this unwanted link.

The invoice status arror must be due to the rentals being linked to the incorrect Invoice.

[~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88] we need more information.

Also, what exactly do you mean by:

“I have looked at these 3 references and there is some similar data across the reservations; perhaps this is causing this unwanted link.”

and “The invoice status error must be due to the rentals being linked to the incorrect invoice.”

Which invoice status error are you referring to?","12/Dec/25 8:35 AM;62e9c03848e310e672957b88;[~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] the invoicing error I was referring to was per the comment from Helena around the invoice status going to completed right away.

When I say there are some similar data across the references I mean that the 3 files mainly referred to in this ticket have been created by the same tester, there are similar first names, email addresses and phone numbers. I am not saying this is the cause of the issue, just trying to offer information that might help solve it.

The fact is there are 21 rentals linked to MBK_Inv_27 and from what I can see that should not be the case, do you know why this may be happening?","17/Dec/25 11:04 AM;615f7778289a54006a3add9b;Hi [~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] The main issue here is that there are 21 rentals linked to MBK_Inv_27 and MEL_Rent_50 is just one of them.

Please note that this occurs when using the “Repeat Reservation” feature and starting rentals from the repeated reservation. In this case, all such rentals will be linked to the same invoice.

However, if you create a new reservation (without using that feature) and then start a rental from that reservation, you will see that this rental is the only one included in the invoice, as shown in the following snapshots:

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

This seems to be occuring for the Make, Model, and Option fields.

Is it possible to remove any case sensitivity in the API so that we can avoid these errors? The make & model fields are particularly different as we get them in a different format quite often from our vehicle lookup integration, so it’s impossible to keep consistent.

E.g. for the “Make” field. If I send across as “Kia” it fails (Screenshot 1) but if I send as “KIA” in uppercase then it works (screenshot 2).

The *Repeat Reservation* link is currently disabled because the system’s rules determine whether this option should be available for a given reservation.

Based on our checks:

* If the reservation is linked to a rental agreement that *has not yet been checked in*, the system will disable the option and display:
*“Repeat Reservation is available only after end rental.”*
* If the reservation is not tied to the *most recent* rental agreement for that vehicle, the system will disable the option with the message:
*“Repeat is allowed only for the latest rental.”*
* And if no completed rental is found for the reservation, the message shown is:
*“No rental found for this reservation.”*

In short, the *Repeat Reservation* feature becomes available only once the related rental has ended and is the latest one in the system. If these conditions aren’t met, the link will remain disabled.","01/Dec/25 3:43 PM;712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa;Hi [~accountid:712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab] thank you.

The exchange form that was signed via the app seems to have the details populated correctly apart from the date of the execution.

* Is there a setting that we need to set to get the date and time zones aligned to the actual location?

Might need to send this back to RC to confirm how we leave it blank.

When we are calling the “AddDamagedVehicle” API, it appears that the fields for InsuranceType and InsuranceCompany are mandatory in the API. However on the UI (for both RentCentric and Reclaim) they are OPTIONAL.

The API needs to be updated to ensure that these fields are OPTIONAL as well.

We’ve reviewed this issue multiple times and confirmed that everything is working correctly.

Please note that the status reflects the vehicle’s current state. When creating a reservation or rental for a future date, the vehicle will appear as available once it has been returned, and its status will update accordingly.

Additionally, all vehicles shown in the vehicle search are those available within the selected reservation/rental period.","05/Dec/25 8:07 AM;62e9c03848e310e672957b88;[~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] in the example above the vehicle was not due to be returned until 21/12/2025 however I was able to reserve it from 01/12/2025, that is 20 days before it is due to be available.","08/Dec/25 7:20 AM;70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c; [~accountid:712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381] [~accountid:712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a] [~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa] [~accountid:615f7778289a54006a3add9b] [~accountid:712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef] [~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88]  

This occurred because inconsistent data was generated across multiple testing processes, leading to duplicate vehicles sharing the same assigned ID. (This duplication issue has now been resolved.) As a result, you may have used one vehicle for the reservation that differs from the vehicle assigned to the referenced rental:

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Please check MEL_Rez_90 as an example.

When we send an MMS reply, Boomi is triggering the API import to RentCentric only once. However the MMS is duplicating in the RentCentric SMS screen 8 times.

You’re getting that issue because you’re using the ""CountryCode"" parameter, but you should be using the ""Country"" parameter instead.

If I use ""CountryCode"", I get the following error:

!image-20251127-112752.png|width=675,alt=""image-20251127-112752.png""!

And if I remove that parameter and use the ""Country"" parameter instead, it works correctly:

Believe this is related to another ticket, no error about the country code

Your comment on the chat earlier today indicates that SSO would only work for logging into the web browser, and that the user would require a separate set of credentials (not SSO) to access the mobile app.

This would provide a poor user experience, lead to lots of login errors and confusion, increase security risks and cause additional IT maintenance work. 

The user needs to be able to access both the web browser and mobile app using the same credentials/SSO account.

Please advise, thanks

This is the latest CreateReservation Payload:

[^CreateReservation (f5143a86-ab6f-4e94-bb69-a8c2d60d4236).txt]

As for why IsBusiness is still empty, it’s because the ""IsBusiness"" parameter wasn’t included in the CreateReservation API. You can find it in the latest API payload.

‘Reserved by’ is empty because it wasn’t included in the API request. I’ve now added a validation to prevent sending it with a null or empty value.

!image-20251125-164852.png|width=675,alt=""image-20251125-164852.png""!

I also updated all reservations that had an empty ‘ReservedBy’ field, assigning the value ‘NA’ so you can update them successfully.

‘Reserved by’ is empty because it wasn’t included in the API request. I’ve now added a validation to prevent sending it with a null or empty value.

I also updated all reservations that had an empty ‘ReservedBy’ field, assigning the value ‘NA’ so you can update them successfully.

Im getting successful response with testing. It seems reclaim isn’t able to receive those.

Tested this one with [~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa]

(Not At Fault ) _Main User (Renter/Primary) = Main User = Owner = Driver_   all of these refer to the same person

similarly, (At Fault) _Main User = Owner = Driver_ all of these refer to the same person

So, rightfully, only _1 Not At Fault_ entry and _1 At Fault entry_ should be listed under Involved Party.



To address the duplication :

_FOR Individuals_

if (Fault Type record 1 = Fault Type record 2) AND (First Name record 1 = First Name record 2) AND (Last Name record 1 = Last Name record 2) AND (Email record 1 = Email record 2) then    Driver Type = (highest priority) 

where 

“Not At Fault”  Main User (Renter/Primary) - customer - 1st priority 
Owner (Individual) - 2nd priority
Driver  - 3rd priority



“At Fault”  Main User  - 1st priority
Owner - 2nd priority
Driver  - 3rd priority



_FOR BUSINESS_

“Not At Fault”  Main User (Renter/Primary) - 1st priority; this will always have value because this is the customer

Owner - Vehicle Owner (Company/Business) 

if (Fault Type record 1 = Fault Type record 2) AND (_Main User (Renter/Primary)_First Name record 1 = _Driver_  First Name record 2) AND (_Main User (Renter/Primary)_ Last Name record 1 =  _Driver_  Last Name record 2) AND (_Main User (Renter/Primary)_ Email record 1 =  _Driver_  Email record 2) then  Driver Type = (highest priority)

This has been addressed:

The reservation # MEL_Rez_83 is assigned to CSE: RC Support, as in the following snapshot:

!image-20251130-214415.png|width=675,alt=""image-20251130-214415.png""!

And here we can see that the task appears normally, and only the Vehicle Checklists that belong to CSE: RC Support are shown, as in the following snapshot:

Please note that to view the tasks, Vehicle Exchanges, or Vehicle Checklists assigned to a user, you must log out and log back in using that user. Also, the task date must be in the future, or you can use the filter to view past or upcoming tasks.","02/Dec/25 10:13 AM;712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa;Hi [~accountid:615f7778289a54006a3add9b] [~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c]  I have tested this and can confirm that I can see the checklist.

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Displaying the actual Make and Model (e.g., _Toyota Camry_) provides customers with clearer expectations about the vehicle they may receive, improving trust and decision-making.
* *Industry Standard Presentation*
Car rental and mobility platforms commonly present vehicles by Make and Model with an “or similar” qualifier. Aligning with this convention enhances user familiarity and reduces confusion.
* *Enhanced Marketing Appeal*
Make and Model descriptions are more recognizable and appealing to customers than generic vehicle types (e.g., “Full-Size”). This can increase conversion rates.

Keeping Vehicle Type for internal functions such as pricing, filtering and reservation logic ensures no disruption to existing business rules, rate tables, or operational workflows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Product / Service enhancement,,,,,,Yogesh Kaparia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Critical,,,,,,,,,,,Fleet System - QA Testing,,,,,,,,,,,,Fields & Data Issues,,,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#deebff}

Regarding the item *“Address Search accepts special characters, should be alphanumeric”*: this isn’t applicable because Google’s address results often include special characters (such as commas and hyphens).

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.

What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.

How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Can we make sure they are consistently called “Registration” and the data of all these “fields” align?

 I've made significant improvements to the drag and drop functionality for the Damage Diagram. Here's a summary of the changes:

  Summary of Improvements

# Larger & More Visible Drop Targets

* Increased hotspot size from 30x30px to 34x34px
* Hotspots now have a subtle background so users can see where to drop
* When dragging starts, hotspots expand to 40x40px making them easier to hit

# Visual Feedback During Drag

* Drag-over highlight: When dragging over a hotspot, it highlights with a blue glow and scales up
* Container awareness: All hotspots become more visible when a drag is in progress
* Marked hotspot feedback: Shows red highlight when hovering over already-marked boxes (to indicate replacement)

# Click-to-Select Alternative (New!)

  Users now have two ways to mark damage:

* Drag & Drop: Traditional method (improved)
* Click-to-Select:
a. Click a damage type (D, S, C, etc.)
b. The selected token gets highlighted
c. All empty hotspots start pulsing
d. Click on any hotspot to apply the mark

  This is much more accurate and works great on all devices.

# Touch Device Support

* Added touch event handlers for mobile/tablet users
* Click-to-select works perfectly on touch devices

# User Experience Enhancements

* Updated tooltips: ""drag or click to select, then click a box""
* Press ESC to cancel selection
* Click outside diagram area to cancel selection
* Clear visual indication of which token is selected

  The drop behavior is now consistent and user-friendly. Users who struggle with drag-and-drop accuracy can simply click to select a damage type, then click on the boxes they want to mark.

So, you can adjust the location setup and the check in / out will be working at the Time you set.

Please note that each location has its own operating hours.

According to the return message:

*{""Status"":""OK"",""Code"":200,""ErrorMessage"":"""",""Result"":{""Message"":""Invalid pickup date. Melbourne HQ is closed at 15:00:00. Please choose a time between 08:00:00 and 12:00:00.""}}*

It appears you’re using the “Melbourne HQ” location instead of “Moorebank”.

Please double-check the request body to ensure that the pickup date falls within the operating hours, and that the pickup location is set to Moorebank, not Melbourne HQ.

Please provide us with the full request you used so we can investigate further.","24/Nov/25 9:03 AM;712020:a918d2b9-2841-4971-89e7-1bdb32217bef;Hi [~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] .

My concern is that its giving me “Status: Ok”,”Code:200” which it should not as it didn’t create a reservation due to the error message - “*Invalid pickup date. Melbourne HQ is closed at 15:00:00. Please choose a time between 08:00:00 and 12:00:00”*

Shiela released the lock by going to other screens, but record lock still remains.  Then “Saved” the record, and they goes to a different screen but it still remains locked. Seems the record lock fails to release.

I have also informed them not to implement incomplete features in Test Env. Now the file seems to be able to be unlocked when user leaves the file. 

I am rejecting this for now and we can revisit this feature in the record locking ticket assigned to them. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,56557,CIP-153,Fleet System,Done,20/Nov/25 12:29 PM

If there are different rates for different durations, then it would be expected for the invoice to display multiple lines, showing the respective timeframes and corresponding rates.

1 off fees are correct but anything requiring multiplication by the 8 day hire period is not correct.

Further to this if there is a long list of charges the invoice does not format to accomodate them.

* If the rate structure is set as Daily Rate = $1 and Weekly Rate = $5, the invoice should reflect separate line items—for example, an 9-day hire should display 7 days (Qty 1)  at $5 = $5 and 2 days (Qty 2) at $1 = $2.
* If the number of line items exceeds the space available on a single-page invoice, the system should automatically generate a second page rather than allowing content to overlap.

Kindly please note there is a setup for the (check in) date / Time is called “Keep Original Return Date at End Rental”
When you *mark the option ON*, so the rental return date will be as is the original return date, and when you *leave it unmarked* so the Rental return date will be the current date/Time you are making the check in.

Currently Melbourne is UTC+11
Melbourne operates on *Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST, UTC+10) or Daylight Time (AEDT, UTC+11)*.

* I tried to “check in” a vehicle at 3:11pm Sydney Time (I am based in Sydney) under Melbourn HQ branch - Melbourne and Sydney are the same time due to Daylight saving
* The iOS app is showing the time as 2:11pm which is 1 hour behind
* !Collection Time.mp4|width=332,alt=""Collection Time.mp4""!




*Is there a setting that we need to configure on our end to fix this or is it something in the backend that needs to be adjusted? If you can let us know please, thank you.*

Kindly note that the Time zone configuration is different at some locations and that’s the reason for making this different,
You can set the Time zone and it suppose match your current time

Also please note by comparing the iOS and android versions, both are reflecting the same Date/Time without Differentness at the time

You can adjust your Location time sone and feedback if the problem still exist.

For example, NRMA is available across multiple branches, but only the Melbourne and Seven Hills branches have corporate rates.

Now, imagine there are over 100 companies operating across the different branches. We’ll need to remember that although NRMA exists in several branches, corporate rates only apply to Melbourne and Seven Hills.

To update those corporate rates, we currently have to go into the company record for each specific branch and update them there, since corporate rates aren’t displayed in the standard “Master Rates” UI. This means we must manually track which company has corporate rates at which branch — and if there are 50 companies with corporate rates across various branches, it becomes quite difficult to manage and remember all of them.

A more efficient approach would be to have _all_ rates (both normal and corporate) listed in the Master Rates UI. We could then add a column indicating whether a rate is “Normal” or “Corporate.” If it’s a corporate rate, the associated company should also be displayed.

This way, we’d manage everything from a single Master Rates UI, simplifying updates and visibility.",,Marcus Wong,osama,Shiela Araullo,,,,,,,615f7778289a54006a3add9b,5d230ed2f61f200c217433a0,712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25/Dec/25 1:54 AM;8d325174-0c5a-4d5e-a79b-ff78394da7f2;image-20251224-145357.png;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/47394,12/Jan/26 2:07 PM;61f47503-0fc0-4c4d-b4d7-47d653f6f802;image-20260112-030637.png;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/49220,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@2c7b357a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#deebff}

I tried one now just with a *Direct hire* and it seems like the *GST is automatically ticked,* but when the customer signed the rental form the GST isn’t showing, and when I checked the file on the desktop version the GST also isn’t included?

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.

All rates - including corporate rates can now be viewed in ‘Master Rates’ UI, however, given all the rates there is no way to identify which ones are corporate and which are not.  Also, for corporate rates, there is no way to identify which company the rates relate to.

So as an enhancement, in ‘Master Rates’, there should be a field that specifies that it is a corporate rate and which company it is linked to.","24/Dec/25 8:42 AM;5d230ed2f61f200c217433a0;[~accountid:712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381]

Hi Team 
1- Regarding “Vehicle filters not working correctly”: its missing data from system
    You should enter (Doors, Seats and Bags)  for every vehicle type at system and filter will work correctly 
2- Regarding “Vehicle Types Names” : You can rename the vehicle types from the system and it will reflect automatically at the website

Therefore, we changed the city field on the website to a drop-down list instead of a text box so that users can select an existing city:

Summary

Review and Update EAG Acronym Usage for Northgate

h2. Context

The business no longer requires the use of ""EAG"" (Eagle Farm) for the Northgate acronym. The BI Team needs to review report mapping to ensure nothing is checking for ""EAG"" specifically. This is a high priority task raised by @Helena Georgiadis on 10/22/2025.

h2. Acceptance criteria

* All report mappings are reviewed for references to ""EAG"" in the context of Northgate.
* Any dependencies or checks for ""EAG"" are updated or removed as required.
* The system no longer uses ""EAG"" for Northgate in any reports or mappings.

Or we just need to update all abbreviation of ranumber to another new abbreviation for NORTHGATE? what is the new abbreaviation? 
Does the new abbreviation will apply as well in TSD system as this is our only source. 

The mapping location of invoices to netsuite is already using NORTHGATE for below abbreviation location.

Should we remove all EAG in TSDRental and back up it to another table “TSDRental_EAG”?  If we remove all EAG in tsdrental table it will apply and also will be remove in all reports as well that using tsdrental table.

Ravi can able to start working on this as priority starting this week or next week. 

List of requirement he need to do: 

1. Add new mapping location for new code = NGT
Use this report link to add new branch location this is using table = [Right2Drive].[R2Drive].[TSDDepot2]
Please kindly provide Ravi the information needed below

+*REPORT LINK:*+
[https://dw-prod.right2drive.com.au/PBReports/report/Admin Access/Add New Branch|https://dw-prod.right2drive.com.au/PBReports/report/Admin%20Access/Add%20New%20Branch]

!image-20251218-005001.png|width=1232,alt=""image-20251218-005001.png""!

Sample record in this table:

!image-20251218-005103.png|width=1212,alt=""image-20251218-005103.png""!




2. Need to set up new database and table source in datawarehouse PROD RDS - [prod-r2d-dw.c1t1ssavnkcs.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com|http://prod-r2d-dw.c1t1ssavnkcs.ap-southeast-2.rds.amazonaws.com]
Dellboomi team will handle the integration sync data process from RENTCENTRIC to DATAWAREHOUSE Tables. We can have a every 1 hour sync update or insert of records to datawarehouse. 

If we can combine others tables into 1 like vehicle exchanges , depends if the tables records from rentcentrix has multiple record attached to 1 ranumber file then we need to create separate table for that. 

Can we include the inserdatetime and updatedatetime from rentcentrix??

*Datawarehouse Table Format required:*

+*Columns required:*+
*ID* - This will identify the auto increament ID of tables. *_Dellboomi team no need to add_* this in there insert process as this will be automatically insert the ID when new records insertted in the table.
*Created Date TBL* - This will identify the datetime it was created the record in the table. *_Dellboomi team no need to add_* this in there insert process as this will be automatically insert the datetime when new records insertted in the table.
*Updated Date TBL* - This will identify the datetime it was updated the record in the table . {color:#ff5630}*_Required to enter data when the file has made some changes from RENTCENTRIC._*{color}


{code:sql}USE [RentCentric]
GO

SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[TableName](
	[ID] [int]					IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	--add new column here
	[Created Date TBL]			datetime default(getdate) not null,
	[Updated Date TBL]			datetime null
){code}





Please dont forget to *_create a primary key_* on each table if we have a unique record and also indexes to prevent issue and performance. 
*_Indexes can be created_* using the foreign column link relationship between others tables reference. 
Other indexes used as well in query will be required to create as well.

Make sure Ravi will  check the table full scan of each query he will built when he will add this in the report. 



*Database Name:*        RentCentric
*Schema:*                      dbo
*Tables:* 				Invoice
					Invoice/Agreements
					Rental
					Rental/InvolvedParties
					Rental/RentalCharges
					Rental/VehicleExchanges[]
					Rental/VehicleExchanges[1]
					Rental/VehicleExchanges[2]
					Rental/VehicleExchanges[3]
					Reservation
					Reservation/InvolvedParties
					Vehicle
					Vehicle/Inspections[]
					Vehicle/Rentals[]
					Vehicle/RepairOrders[]
					DamageVehicles
					Customers
					Audit Logs??? 
                                    	

3. Create a view master table for Rentals and separate view for Reservation for Rentcentic under the database rentcentric . The 2 view will be using in the reports so that we can have only 1 source table and if there will be new changes or additional information need we can just update the view instead and avoid updating all reports which will be easier for BI Team. 




4. Create a TEST Report on existing reports that was using the TSD RENTAL or TSD RENTAL XML tables and need to add new table for rentcentrix need to union the 2 tables from TSD RENTAL and new rentcentrix.

Summary

Implement Save Without Proceeding Functionality Across Operational Screens

h2. Context

The system currently requires users to complete all mandatory fields before saving entries. There is a need to allow users to save partial data entries on all operational screens without proceeding, enabling follow-up actions when complete information is not initially available. This enhancement is prioritised as high and was raised by Krizia Fontarum on 10/13/2025.

h2. Acceptance criteria

* Users can save incomplete or partial data entries on all operational screens without being forced to proceed to the next step.
* Saved partial entries can be retrieved and completed at a later time.
* The system clearly indicates which entries are incomplete or require additional information before final submission.
* No data is lost when saving partial entries.

The “cancel” button doesn’t do anything.
The “done” works the same logic as “add slot” button currently.
In general application, the following logics should apply: 
*“Cancel”*
* Discards any changes the user has made.
* Returns the user to the previous screen without saving.
* Essentially means _“undo and exit.”_
*“Done”*
* Saves any modifications the user has made.
* Confirms and applies the settings.
* Closes the settings screen once changes are saved.

I noticed that you tried to create a rate on the production system:

!image-20251114-173736.png|width=464,alt=""image-20251114-173736.png""!

If you want to create a rate on the production system using the API, you must generate a new token using the production token API:

[https://www8.rentcentric.com/RcOnlineAPI_Client8328/api/token|https://www8.rentcentric.com/RcOnlineAPI_Client8328/api/token]

If you used the same token from the test system, the rate will be created in the test environment—even if you're using the production API URL:

[https://www8.rentcentric.com/RcOnlineAPI_Client8328/|https://www8.rentcentric.com/RcOnlineAPI_Client8328/]

I'm mentioning this because I found that the rate was created successfully in the test system but not in production, as shown in the snapshot below.

As an admin, I was able to disable user from creating/starting a new reservation/rental from web platform. However, the mobile app still allows user to create new reservation/start new rental directly from the app and these files show blank reservation type and the reservations are not accessible. 
User should not be able to use the mobile app to create reservation or start a rental (without reservation). This creates corrupted files. |",,abdalla ebada,Helena Georgiadis,Marcus Wong,Vicki Hartley,,,,,,5d1dac3e1831070d1cd283ef,712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a,615f7778289a54006a3add9b,6195e625f241500072581555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CIP-603,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,06/Nov/25 2:11 PM;712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a;image-20251106-031113.png;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/40536,27/Nov/25 4:50 AM;08afc845-f347-41ec-ae43-87708361c3c8;image-20251126-174904.png;https://movigo.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/attachment/content/42024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,com.atlassian.servicedesk.plugins.approvals.internal.customfield.ApprovalsCFValue@13a829ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Logged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|i06wwg:zzzzy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Major,,,,,,,,,,,Fleet System - QA Testing,,,,,,,,,,,,Mobile App,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Training for user not to create res/rental directly from the mobile app. ,,2025-11-26 05:12:33.106,10569_*:*_1_*:*_45493927_*|*_10570_*:*_1_*:*_3014_*|*_10164_*:*_1_*:*_1735276245_*|*_10571_*:*_1_*:*_2845_*|*_10542_*:*_1_*:*_0,26/Nov/25 4:12 PM;6195e625f241500072581555;[~accountid:5c8a70adee0f2d70e23c5f4a]  can you please advise on this?

There was also a memo option - which is again a repeat of notes, which they have also removed. Also, now we can hover-over the notes, so if the notes was too long we can view the content when we hover-over.  So, the issue is not address, and this ticket can be closed.

All the required fields should be appearing in the RC Invoice webhook now, see example below just received into Boomi now (execution-3921c97a-c7bb-45b8-8470-adc65d4cdb71-2025.11.20).

Can you please finish the mapping of this across to Reclaim/NetSuite?

Also just to note our previous conversation about the FileURL. For the invoice webhook, you can assume it will always be a “.pdf” format type and you can default the file name to “Invoice{InvoiceNumber}” (e.,g., “InvoiceMEL_Rent_21”). 

Thanks!

You shouldn’t start a rental using the mobile agent app. Please check with Marcus.

* I created the reservation via desktop
* But on-hired the file via the iOS app, are we meant to on hire the vehicle via the desktop?



Reservation is MEL-Rez---9

* Created on 17/11/2025 do I have to try with a newer file?

Please note that, based on the initial requirements we received and according to the Confluence Credit Page requirements:

[https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FMS/pages/1471807492/1.4.4+Credit+Reservation|https://movigo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FMS/pages/1471807492/1.4.4+Credit+Reservation]

Most fields on the Credit page are not editable, including:

Status

Claim ID

Source of Business

Referral Agency

Referral Agent

Vehicle Type

Delivery/Pickup Country

Return/Drop-off Country

Rate Plan Type

Daily Rate

Additionally, all Accident Details fields are mandatory and also non-editable:

!image-20251114-141450.png|width=464,alt=""image-20251114-141450.png""!

Therefore, we need the complete requirements and the full scenario for creating a Credit reservation through the system. ","17/Nov/25 11:08 AM;615f7778289a54006a3add9b;Hi [~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] Thanks for the details. You are correct that the original requirements for Credit reservation was only created via API and those mandatory fields should be populated via API. 

However, there was a critical request to also allow Credit reservation to be created manually and directly in the system couple of months ago. We would like to know if we prioritize this critical enhancement, what would be the efforts to implement and impacts on the fields and existing flow?

cc: [~accountid:712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381] ","18/Nov/25 8:30 AM;70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c;Hi [~accountid:615f7778289a54006a3add9b] 

To allow creating a credit reservation through the system, all required fields would need to be editable. However, this would also affect reservations coming from the API, since these fields would become editable and anyone could modify values originally set by the API.

Therefore, we need clarification on the expected scenario:

What should happen when creating a new credit reservation through the system?

What should happen when editing a reservation that was originally created through the API?","18/Nov/25 12:38 PM;615f7778289a54006a3add9b;[~accountid:712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a] 
As per the original requirements and the current system configuration, Credit Reservations can only be created via the API (Reclaim). Any attempt to create a Credit Reservation manually is therefore expected to fail and should not be considered a valid defect. An enhancement request will be required if we need to reassess this behaviour.

Could you please help us understand the potential impact on the API if these fields were to be made editable and/or non-mandatory?","18/Nov/25 3:51 PM;712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381;[~accountid:615f7778289a54006a3add9b]  When a credit reservation is created via the API, all existing rules must apply — for example, any non-editable fields must remain non-editable.

When a credit reservation is created via the UI (which the system can detect because the creation is initiated through the UI), the mandatory fields should be editable during the creation process. Once the credit reservation is saved, the standard behaviour should resume — meaning that when the credit hire record is subsequently viewed or edited, any fields that are normally non-editable should again become non-editable.  After the credit reservation is saved, the system will trigger a webhook to Reclaim, which will return the CID. This CID must then be synced back to the RC UI.","18/Nov/25 3:58 PM;615f7778289a54006a3add9b;Thanks [~accountid:712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381] 

[~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] Can this be addressed as a critical enhancement for making the mandatory fields editable as per Shiela’s explaination below? Or what would be the effort? I will bring this up with [~accountid:5c8a70adee0f2d70e23c5f4a] ","19/Nov/25 8:54 AM;70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c;[~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa] [~accountid:615f7778289a54006a3add9b] [~accountid:712020:13591975-f53d-475c-bb72-248a5decf24a] [~accountid:712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381] [~accountid:6195e625f241500072581555] 

This has been completed, and you can now create credit reservations through the system, as shown in the following snapshots:

!image-20251118-215338.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251118-215338.png""!



!image-20251118-214919.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251118-214919.png""!

!image-20251118-214948.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251118-214948.png""!

And when editing the reservation, the fields become disabled again as requested.

!image-20251118-215132.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251118-215132.png""!","19/Nov/25 4:43 PM;712020:87cb2a66-52ac-416f-828a-b715b9cfe381;thanks, [~accountid:70121:aa6b385e-c582-463a-accc-238cc59fa71c] 

Now that credit hire records can be created manually through the UI, and a _Claim ID_ is still mandatory, users can enter a “_temporary Claim ID_” until the valid one is generated in Reclaim (e.g. screenshot below Claim ID = ‘CID’)

However, once a manually created credit hire record is saved, the _Claim ID_ field becomes non-editable when the record is reopened. This prevents users from updating it with the correct Claim ID (from Reclaim).

To resolve this, an _admin_ should have the ability to override the non-editable state of the _Claim ID_ field. This would allow the _admin_ to update the field once the correct Claim ID becomes available, ensuring it is synchronised with Reclaim.

This has been done:

If the admin doesn’t have the permission “Edit Claim ID“, the “claim ID” field will be disabled:

!image-20251119-212004.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251119-212004.png""!

!image-20251119-212100.png|width=656,alt=""image-20251119-212100.png""!

And if the admin has that permission, the “Claim ID “ field will be enabled:

For credit, when reservation channel = ‘API - Reclaim’, it does not allow CID edit even if admin has ‘Edit Claim Id’ permission - since value is already coming from Reclaim.  But when reservation channel <>  ‘API - Reclaim’, which means that the reservation is manually created, it then allows the admin to update the CID.

We have checked the inbound messages from our side and it works as in the snapshot below.

Could you please let me know how you are sending the inbound messages?
Are you sending them through Postman, or is there another application that sends these messages dynamically?

I have sent you the latest update of the inbound request. Please make sure you are following the same request format (if you send the request from a specific app dynamically you need to check it sends the latest updated request), including the messageId and all other identifiers.


If the issue still persists, please send us the exact request you are using so that we can investigate it further.

The outbound SMS is showing up in rentcentric twice (which might be a RC issue, or Boomi, not sure) AND the inbound reply SMS is not loading at all anymore. Or perhaps the inbound reply SMS is loading the wrong content (it should say “inbound” but it’s showing as outbound).

Please check which fields are mapping across

We tested the issue on our side using Postman, and everything is working as expected. To ensure the issue is not coming from our side, please use Postman to send the requests and then check the messages under the reservation or rental.

I also noticed that Vicki reported the issue might be related to some changes made by FYI-MsgMedia which means it’s not from our side.

So, ive imported using this NSW.csv file

There are now 2 vehicleIDs - isnt this supposed to be “identity” field in the database? which means - unless we want to overwrite the existing record - vehicleid should be blank and be a running counter “identity” field. Now, that we specify vehicleid in the upload file, it looks like it does not match that of the one in the URL.  Which causes the confusion on which is the correct vehicleid to use. And if vehicleid is specified in the upload csv file, we then need to keep track of what the current max id so as not to overwrite with what is already in the database - and is that vehicleid unique per branch id per vehicleid?

As discussed with Alex and [~accountid:5c8a70adee0f2d70e23c5f4a] , the original record-locking mechanism presents significant challenges. The following alternative solution is therefore proposed:

# When a user is actively working on a file, and a second user attempts to access the same record, a *popup notification* should appear informing the second user that the file is currently being edited by another user (displaying the *User ID*) and cannot be modified until it is released.
# Once the file has been unlocked, if the second user is still viewing the record, they must *refresh or re-enter the page* before any edits can be made.
# The *System Administrator* should have the ability to *manually unlock records* that have remained locked beyond a defined period of inactivity. This ensures operational continuity and prevents disruptions caused by abandoned or stale sessions.

This rule should apply at a minimum to the following modules:

* *Reservation*
* *Rental* (linked to Reservation for locking)","19/Nov/25 11:57 PM;5c8a70adee0f2d70e23c5f4a;[~accountid:712020:3f46b471-1bc5-47d1-91a4-8fed231066ab] please check snapshots

Shall we onboard them with “2” in the email and have them login to 8432 directly or onboard their real emails so they can access 8432 via production (8328)?

I get the following everytime I login to either 8432 or 8328, never got to the page for selecting environment. Can you please provide some guidance? Thanks.

As we agreed in the last meeting with James, you will log in to the production environment first, and from there you can access the test or UAT environments.

To log in, please use the following URL:
[https://fleet.right2drive.com.au/|https://fleet.right2drive.com.au/]

To navigate from production to the other environments, please go to the profile page and enter your username and password (e.g., the credentials you use for your account on the test system), as shown in the snapshot below.

It also requires lots of material to be referenced as you read through the flows.

We require a comprehensive database that shows call flows, where prompts and TTS are played and what is said so that there is an accurate visual for each call flow that can be called upon when required.

There is a piece of software called ‘Uplinx’ that can read call flows directly from Amazon connect that could be used but there is a cost for this.

Once the Amazon connect cleanse is complete we will understand the number of active call flows and understand the extent of effort required to properly map and maintain them, based on this we can make a decision as to whether the task is manageable in house or whether an alternative solution is required.",,Gary Brighton,,,,,,,,,62e9c03848e310e672957b88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,432000,28800,,0%,432000,28800,,,CIP-128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"*Given* I am a customer

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Later,,,,,Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,,,"{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

Currently, file allocation is driven by a custom-built logic based on the principle of the least file count, which means the above-mentioned product feature will not be applicable.
*If email notifications are required for allocation and reallocation events, an estimated development effort of two days will be needed.*

Hi Elizabeth ,

There are a few alternatives provided by Newgen Product Team as direct pop on the screen is not feasible, we are preforming a level of proof of concept and will schedule a call with you for tomorrow to provide a brief around currently available alternative. 

*Thanks and Regards*

There was another option of colour coding the new lead - this is a code change which will require some time Jody + Kriza taking lead with Vicki

Email notification was not selected to proceed. ","16/May/25 1:41 PM;5f7e4265459d420069adea7b;I have just spoken with Vineesh confirmed the below:

* New file will be highlighted in different colour
* Side notification will show individual file count for agents to monitor

Wil take 15hrs of effort including recode and criteria, with a total of 2.5 days to deploy in total. 

Solution has been put into sprint 21 to be in production 19th June - If the team requires this as an Urgent Hot Fix it will need to be requested by the business with a possible launch date of 29th May

*_Blocked:_*
Jody told me to blocked the booking stats for agents and team because of some reason that we cannot able to get the accurate actioned of each agent that they have booked in Zendesk for standard files.


*_Please kindly see my updates_* 

# Speed of contact - 
 Over All - use note type = Application Form / Customer Contact OR Caller ID is not empty & Do not filter any agent
Agent - use note type = Application Form / Customer Contact OR Caller ID is not empty & filter lead allocation agent
# Remove resigned agent that has END DATE
# Add Booking Info
Over All - use Hire Service requested date for Date of booking
Booked In - Master Status not Rejected or Cancelled and *Hire Status not Hire Cancelled*
Cancel after Booked In - Master Status not Rejected or Cancelled and *Hire Status = Hire Cancelled*

Overflow to site lead would have only been viable in the scenario where we route calls to mobiles which we decided was not a good option due to the likelihood of lost information, as such I have removed that user story.

I also asked about the viability of booking a return using IVR and due to the nature of information required when organising a return this may prove difficult, branch require the following

* Date
* Time
* Location
* File Number

They also advise return T’s and C’s.

Date, time and file number can be done using the phone keypad and location could be done using voice recognition but this does present a lot of opportunity for error and could be quite lengthy, language barriers also present a potential problem. I have struck through the user story for now.

An incoming call alert to Amazon connect in branch is not very loud, there is a visual prompt and a ring tone but the ring tone is quiet and may go though a users headset/headphones. This is the reason that Ben has had to roster people to sit at the desk so the phone can be heard.

There is usually at least one person at a branch at any given time that can answer the phone, we just need to make sure that the phone can be heard.

Branch get around 54 calls a day across all branches with is about 3 per branch per day however someone has to watch the phone in case it rings. (see attached spreadsheet)

Ensuring people can hear the phone ringing without having to sit at the desk and answer without needing to be logged into a laptop will greatly reduce the impact of this issue and mean that all staff can assist in answering calls.

I spoke further with Sasha and Ben regarding the use of Amazon connect and this supported the ideas I had of the limitations in place using Amazon connect, someone must be logged in to a laptop with Amazon connect to answer the phone, being away from the desk means calls will likely be missed.

I remember long ago that branch used landlines which suited the environment as it meant whoever was free/best placed to answer the phone could, Amazon connect was preferred however due to its performance monitoring capabilities. It seems to me the best options is something with the freedom of use of a landline with the performance monitoring of AC

I reached out to Joemar at ixceed and explained to him what I was thinking and he advised that we would need to check with their solutions architect and they will arrange a meeting for next Wednesday with Jody and Alister in my stead.

I think most local ops users are receving the incoming call notifications ok and using Amazon connect while on the move is somthing we want to avoid to prevent lost infomation however point 2 is very interesting as it looks like it could achieve the solution we are after.

But for the Least cost per vehicle per day , I need to create a ticket to Deepak to ask about the mapping or computation where i can able this cost amount per day and if we can able to linked that in reclaim as well, I will include you in the meeting with Deepak once he replied back in the email.

# *Least cost per vehicle per day*  - can use NETSUITE as source data.  Deepak Bhardwaj gives me the calculation and mapping.  Can be mapped in reclaim using the Unit # of vehicle thru TSD and get the RANUMBER.

*FORMULA*:  
       Lease cost per day  = Total Lease Payment / ((Lease end Date - Lease Start Date) +1)

2. *Lead Fee Paid* - can use NETSUITE as source data. Carlito Obejera gives us the source mapping location snapshot but has 2 different source. 
The other 1 is using the old process that using *_entity TAMMS and different GL Account = 53020 REFERRAL COSTS : Referral commission - Leads_*.
The 2nd is using new process that using *_entity Right2drive and GL Account = 53010 REFERRAL COSTS : Referral commission - vehicle hire._*  Which is not a lead fee now but it should only called as +*_refferal cost vehicle hire_*+. 

We are still waiting for Nicolas Rio response on this.

I have added the *Paid Referral Fee* in our report and created a separate table view summary and details for vendor for you to review, I used CID and invoice number to linked them in reclaim but we still need another one filter to link them to the matching Reclaim Referral Agency. Please see below investigation issue i found:

#  Vendor Name in netsuite is different and not exactly the same on the Reclaim Referral Agency value format
 - This mean we might have problem matching the netsuite paid referral fee amount with same netsuite vendor name = reclaim referral agency. 
# Reclaim Referral Agency is BLANK 
- not all files in reclaim is correctly updated by our agents which will cause not to see the correct amount that should be linked to file. We might need to fix this or we can have a differnt overview for the Paid Referral fee and create a separate table summary since the name in netsuite is not matching the value format in reclaim referral agency.

For point 1, as the Reclaim CID reference is present in both tables can we use that to reconcile data rather than the referrer name?

For point 2, I had hoped that data in Reclaim would be better as we introduced an enhancement towards the end of 2024 to ensure the correct referrer was being captured, is the issue of blank referrers affecting data for a certain period or is it widespread?

","11/Jun/25 12:05 PM;712020:97506884-5394-4df6-9980-ffcdff5a59a3;[~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88], 

For Blank Referral Agency , you can select the the below table and select the BLANK value of referral agency and there it will interract and filter with all tables below and the vendor tables you will see in vendor details all CID linked to those reclaim referral agency = BLANK but in *_netsuite they have populated the vendor name correctly and has paid them already_*. 

If we want to use Reclaim Referral agency , we need to make sure there is no BLANK there so that we can identify clearly what is the correct analysis for all referral agency especialy on the numbers of files and the amount we have paid and invoiced.


Second, for linking the netsuite vendor name to Reclaim file, in the sample screenshot below i have filter only this CID-00061840, and here we can see in Reclaim Referral Agency = Blank  but in netsuite we will see it has 2 vendor company that has paid the referral fee. This mean we can have multiple referral in 1 invoice or reclaim CID file.  In our report analysis we want to see how many paid referral fee has been paid on this referral agency . And also the reclaim referal agency with blank values i think we need to fixed this to have a full insights on what to analyse.

If want to mapped the Netsuite Vendor company name vs. the reclaim referral agency the other work around is to create a mapping table for netsuite and reclaim referral agency that will linked together. It will need to maintain time by time if there is any changes in netsuite and also in reclaim reference list. 
But if we dont want to mapped this 2, other work around is to have a separate table for netsuite paid referral fee and use the Netsuite vendor name there.  It will be the same with least cost per day so we can summarize them in 1 table the 2 amount for paid referral fee and least cost per day amount. 

This is only my suggestions, but please let me know what is your final decision or asked the users that will be using this report.

It is fair to assume that TSD and Netsuite are largely aligned as there is a degree of integration however Reclaim is a concern for me.

I would like us to use Netsuite as the source of truth but retain this function where data from Reclaim, TSD and Netsuite can be reviewed.

The first example I looked at showed that the referrer listed in Reclaim matched TSD/Netsuite but showed as blank in the report.

The second example however showed Movigo marketing as the referrer indicating that the customer would have heard of us from a marketing source which does not align with TSD/Netsuite, this could be an error but should be investigated if it is widespread.

Again the data you have provided shows the Reclaim ‘referrer’ as blank.

Would it be possible to get these blanks filled in? We can then better analyse the differences and try to determine the reasons.","17/Jun/25 12:08 PM;712020:97506884-5394-4df6-9980-ffcdff5a59a3;[~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88] Hi [~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88]This is what im using as criteria to get the referrer agency in reclaim did we made any changes with the rules ?

We changed this and linked the referrer to the ‘Lead Source’, see [https://movigo.atlassian.net/issues/REP-153?jql=textfields%20~%20%22referrer%20lead%20source%2A%22%20AND%20assignee%20%3D%2062e9c03848e310e672957b88|https://movigo.atlassian.net/issues/REP-153?jql=textfields%20~%20%22referrer%20lead%20source%2A%22%20AND%20assignee%20%3D%2062e9c03848e310e672957b88|smart-link] 

The only data you should need to source for each file would be the ‘Referrer’ field regardless of the referrer type as the referrer type is captured in the ‘Lead Source’ field.

There are 2 scenarios were there will be no referrer listed which is where the lead source is either ‘Friend’ or ‘Insurer' in these scenarios alternative fields are displayed ‘Referral person name’ for ‘Friend’ and ‘Referring Insurer’ for ‘Insurer’

Looking at the rest of the data where there is not an exact match there are mainly slight name differences or payments to people or different companies.

As long as we are able to link the referral fees paid on a rental to the 3 sources of data we can determine who the referrer is, as such I would like to keep the ‘Issues Referral Agency’ tab in the report.

However I have reviewed the prototype and have some feedback

*Net Income Column is missing*
This is a calculation field for each referral:

Invoice total - Write off - Lead Fee - Cost of goods/lease = Net Income

!image-20250717-055822.png|width=1549,height=461,alt=""image-20250717-055822.png""!

*Cost of Goods/Lease*
The lease cost per day only seems to be capturing for some files, it should be present on all files where we have provided a vehicle which should be the majority of the data. 

The lease cost in the report is for the day and does not calculate to show the entire vehicle costs over each rental period which we would need to track profitability against each referral.

If we are not able to show the costs of goods/lease for the entire rental for each referral then perhaps we should omit this data either from the ‘Net Income’ calculation or from the report altogether and take into account where required using another method.

*All Others*
Canclled and rejected look good though a little light on data I will let Nic review that and advise.

For the Lease cost per day our condition in netsuite, based on Deepak recommendation. 
Lease cost per day will only get if the lease has EMPTY disposal date (means exclude all files for disposal)
and it should have Asset is lease = T (means it has lease attached to it)

If you want to verify those files that has empty lease cost per day we can ask FINANCE team (DIANA) who has more knowledge on the process from there side. 

Many thanks 🙂

Based on what I am seeing in the data it appears we may only be capturing leases whereas all will have a running costs associated to them, cost of goods or COGs for short.

The COGs does not seem to be being captrued and to be fair it may be difficult to capture this data in the report, for each lead we would need to know the COG and the hire period the multiply one by the other then total up the results of this calculation for each referral, do you think this would be possible?",18/Jul/25 9:35 AM;712020:97506884-5394-4df6-9980-ffcdff5a59a3;[~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88] i think that is already the lease cost per day right that is related to COGS? is there other new one ? if you can give me a sample ranumber and screenshot in TSD online where we can locate this and also the correct formula. ,18/Jul/25 9:43 AM;62e9c03848e310e672957b88;[~accountid:712020:97506884-5394-4df6-9980-ffcdff5a59a3] I will speak with Sajana on Monday to ensure that we understand how all COGS data is stored and get back to you to ensure we are gathering everything.,"18/Jul/25 11:45 AM;62e9c03848e310e672957b88;[~accountid:712020:97506884-5394-4df6-9980-ffcdff5a59a3] I have spoken with [~accountid:62f5c74b50bd9783f62dd73d] and we can drop the COGS/Lease metric from the report as he does not think it will add much value and it is proving a difficult metric to include, please remove the column from the summary.","18/Jul/25 12:09 PM;712020:97506884-5394-4df6-9980-ffcdff5a59a3;Hi [~accountid:62e9c03848e310e672957b88] I have updated the report and remove the lease cost per day amount field,

Cancelled - Filter only Cancelled Reason is not BLANK
Rejected -  Filter only Rejected Reason is not BLANK

Do we want to change the criteria based on Master Status = Cancelled & Rejected ?

* Can we route a call based on users skillset
** Routes calls to best placed user
* Can we route to user who is best placed to answer phone call such as the most recent user to action the file, but then route to team if the initial user is not available
** Benefit of this would be reduced handle time as users are familiar with the file

*How will an ER be assessed?*
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The problem (or opportunity) will be assessed and the outcomes sought will be used to guide the development of solutions that meet the stated objectives (‘To Be’).
{panel}

# There are likely to be multiple solution options and solutions can be a composite of system, process and people changes to solve a problem.
# Consideration will be given to the delivery of a solution (e.g. can the delivery be broken down into smaller components to enable faster realization of benefits?
# Can a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) be delivered that meets some of the business objectives and can evolve in to a more complete solution once it is operational and its effectiveness evaluated?)

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The rationale will be used to guide decisions on what solution will deliver the best value to the organization.
{panel}

# This is the cost:benefit analysis required to ensure that a solution is chosen that is not over-engineered and is ‘fit for purpose’.

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
The measures of success will be defined and agreed review checkpoints will be put in place to track progress towards achieving the benefits of delivering the ER.
{panel}

# This approach will allow reviews to take place and adjustments to be made in future if the benefits are not being realized.

What is the business problem (or opportunity) we are trying to address?
{panel}

#  There must be a clear business objective for requesting the ER.
# Solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity must demonstrate a tangible benefit to the organization.
# The business problem (or opportunity) is not a solution statement.  There could be multiple options to solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity.  Specifying a solution without exploring options can result in delivering an outcome that does not meet the business objectives.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
What is the rationale for solving the problem (or pursuing the opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the scope of the problem (or opportunity) and the impact on business performance?  This could include efficiency, cost, revenue, cashflow, legal & compliance impacts.
# How systemic is the problem (e.g. does it occur frequently / infrequently, does it impact a small number of files or most files, does it impact a small group of stakeholders or the whole organization?)
# If we do not know this and cannot quantify the impact the problem (or opportunity) has on the organization, this information is required to support a decision on whether to proceed with the ER.



{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
How will we ensure that the enhancement addresses the business problem (or opportunity)?
{panel}

# Do we understand the current state (‘As Is’) of the business function(s) impacted by the problem (or opportunity)?  If not, this is required to form the baseline for solution option development.
# Do we understand what success looks like?  How will we measure that the objective(s) of the ER have been met?  This is important in being able to demonstrate a commitment to achieving the benefits claimed in undertaking the ER.

*Given* a customer has called

*When* they are on hold

*Then* they are advised of their queue position -and potential wait time-



*Given* a customer has called

*When* they decide to continue to hold

*Then* they are played hold music and played marketing messages that are on a 3 minute loop



*Given* a customer has called

*When* the hold period starts

*Then* they are offered the option of a virtual hold, scheduled call back or to continue holding



*Given* a customer has gone on virtual hold

*When* they hang up their phone

*Then* their queue position is maintained



*Given* a customer is organising a callback

*When* they are selecting their call back time

*Then* they are only able to book times between 8:30am and 5pm



*Given* a customer is organising a callback

*When* they are selecting their call back time

*Then* only two callbacks can be booked per 30 minute time slot



*Given* a customer is organising a callback

*When* the time slot they want is fully booked

*Then* the customer is advised of the next available time slot



*Given* a call to a customer is initiated

*When* selecting what user to route the call to

*Then* Amazon will integrate with Reclaim to route the call to the file handler if possible



*Given* a customer hangs up

*When* they have been on hold for 10 seconds or longer

*Then* an SMS should be sent to the caller asking if they would like to organise a callback



*Given* we are calling back a virtual hold customer

*When* the call is not connected

*Then* the call is treated as abandoned and added to the abandoned call queue



*Given* this enhancement is in place

*When* a manager is viewing Amazon connect

Upon the first missed call to Talia’s extension a missed call is shown (below image) but I then made a second call from my phone and AC continued to only show the first missed call.

It is only if I leave a voicemail that Talia is notified I tried to contact her via email with a transcript of the voicemail message.

Ideally we would be able to see a call history similar to what you see on a mobile phone showing incoming, outgoing and missed calls over time.

When you say customer - are we referring to the referrer or the actual NAF and will the measure be put in the referral portal or the R2D webportal, wherein we already have the customer’s details from the repairer and then the NAF tried to create an application via the website they will get an alert saying we already have an application for them?","07/Jul/25 9:51 AM;62e9c03848e310e672957b88;[~accountid:712020:7db64c45-139b-4582-abaa-4c3fa98288fa] when I say customer here I did mean the NAF, if they go online and the referrer submits via the portal then we need to ensure that the referrer gets their fee. We also want to prevent both ops and an RSM doing the same task. 

I anticipated this requirement being addressed in Reclaim when a lead is received a function to allow users to cross check against existing leads to ensure there is no double up. I’m glad you raised this as this is not addressed in the Confluence page and I need to understand what meassures if any are in place today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,02/Apr/25 9:52 AM
